# Alien Race (Java version)

This is a port of my Alien Race game that I originally wrote in C++ using the SDL image library.

It was ported to Java as it was such a simple game it was better suited to being embedded into a webpage for play.

The code structure is organised to help follow the MVC design pattern. 

If you wish to see a working demoable version, contact me at dwfaithfull@gmail.com.
